                It is one of the largest sea turtles. An interesting fact about this turtle is that despite it’s name suggesting it as “green”, the turtle is not of that color. Instead it has a layer of body fat that is actually green underneath it’s carapace. Green turtles feed on seagrass and algae and the seagrass that they consume digests in a short time and is then released as recycled nutrients to the plants and species that exist underwater. They are able to traverse long distances between it’s feeding and breeding sites and the place where it resides. They are one of the most common to exist in sri lankan waters. However, despite them being protected they are becoming endangered.

                        Its name was derived from the fact that it has a beak that’s narrow and pointed. They are mainly known for their beautiful shell, which is in demand because of the pattern on the shell which makes its edges give a serrated-look and so is used to make ornaments and jewelry. This has led to them being hunted down as well. They get rid of prey like sponges from the reef’s surface which allows reef fish to feed on them more easily without them being at risk which ensures that the coral reefs remain healthy.

                        It’s name originated from the fact that they have a large head which supports their powerful jaw muscles. This makes it easier for them to squeeze and protect themselves against hard-shelled prey such as clams lurking in the ocean. Also, they are rarely captured for their meat or shell and are less likely to become victim of accidental catch by fishermen. One of the reasons why they matter is because they carry colonies of tiny plants and animals over their shells, making them an important habitat.

                    It was given this name due to their shell which looks like a leather unlike other types of turtles that have a hardened-shell. This is the largest of the five types of sea turtles to exist in sri lanka and are also rare to come across. They have a distinctive black and white striped shell along with lengthy flippers at the front, which makes them recognizable. Even though it is a cold-blooded reptile, their blood continues to remain warm despite residing in cold water, which is very unique. Every year, at least five leatherbacks come for nesting at the Kosgoda beach.

                        Their shell has a color shade of olive green, which is partly how it got its name. comparatively to other sea turtles, they are more widespread as well, even in Sri Lanka. They are the smallest sea turtles to be found, and their tiny size makes them look cute. The only concern is that they nest only in very few locations as a result, even if one nest beach is disrupted their population would be impacted by a great deal this is also because they release many eggs inside one nest itself.
