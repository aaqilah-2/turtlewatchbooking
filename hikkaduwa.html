                            The sea turtle hatchery and rescue center is located only a short distance away from the Hikkaduwa town. The goal of this hatchery exists is to prevent the sea turtles from extinction. The amount of turtle eggs, shells and meat being illegally traded amount industry continues to rapidly increase and the survival of turtles during their early stages of life are some of the main reasons why the turtle population has been declining over the past years. The hatchery tries to salvage the turtle population while spreading awareness and teaching the locals and tourists about turtles and why they must be conserved.
