            <h1> INTRODUCTION TO SRILANKAN TURTLE HATCHERIES </h1><br><br>
            <p> Out of the seven living sea turtle species to exist in the world, five of them are reported to be found along the coastal belt of the island coming to nest. You can find the green turtle, olive ridley, hawksbill, loggerhead and leatherback residing in the shores of SriLanka.
                Turtle watching is an inexplicable experience that’s bound to stay with you. Observing these sea creatures slowly swimming, searching for their next meal, or moving themselves towards to a sandy beach for nesting.
                However, some of these beautiful sea creatures are on the verge of being extinct, where as some have been reported to be critically endangered by the IUCN. It is not surprising that one of the main causes that has led to this devastating decline of the turtle population in sri lanka are human beings. Sea turtles are being killed for their eggs, flesh, skin, and shells, and are also at risk to poaching. In addition, their habitat is being destroyed (coastal development and rising seas due to climate change), and they often get accidentally caught in fishing gear by fishermen which is a problem.
            </p><br>
            <p> In order to protect the turtles and preserve their population hatcheries have been created. A hatchery is designed to increase the number of hatchlings that reach the sea and help them get through the critical stages of their early life. 
            The first ever sea turtle hatchery that was established in Sri Lanka was during 1956 at Yala National Park by the Wildlife and Nature protection Society of Sri Lanka, a non-governmental organization for nature conservation.

                <p>
                     The green turtle is a herbivore, and seagrass is one of their favorite diets. They prevent taller seagrass from harming other marine life and facilitate fish reproduction by keeping short 
                     seagrass. Their eating patterns contribute to the health of aquatic life. The digestion process of green turtle breakdown sea grass, releasing nutrients back into the ecosystem.

                    <h3>Sea Turtles are the Ocean’s Best Navigators -</h3>
                <p>
                    Amazing senses of direction are possessed by sea turtles. They navigate the vast ocean seas 
                    with ease and grace thanks to their internal GPS, which takes use of the earth's magnetic field. In fact, females can find their way back to the 
                    same beach where they were born to lay their own eggs, regardless of how many hundreds of kilometers separate them.

                <li> <b>Coral Reefs - </b>
                    <p class="text-wrap">Hawksbills are renowned for exclusively eating a few different kinds of sea sponges and are known to reside on coral reefs. Due to the proliferation of rare sponge species encouraged by this diet, the diversity of life on the reef- often referred to as "biodiversity"- is increased. Without hawksbills turtles, sponges might overgrow, suffocate, and kill slow-growing corals. Due to the growing threat that climate change and other factors pose to reefs, the hawksbill turtle's significance on the reef is enhanced.</p>
                </li> 
                <li><b>Beaches-</b>
                    <p class="text-wrap">Even when they are not swimming in the watre, sea turtles are helpful. Sea turtles that are nesting benefit beaches becasue they place their eggs on the sand. Unhatched eggs and eggshells are important sources of nutrients for beach grasses and other dune flora, both of which help to reinforce dunes and prevent coastal erosion.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Turtle Prey- </b>
                    <p class="text-wrap">Although there are many different types of sea turtles, most of them prefer jellyfish as food. The population of leatherback sea turtles is regulated because they are adept at eating jellyfish. Jellyfish numbers would soa if leatherbacks went extinct, disrupting the balance of marine biodiversity. Without jellyfish, there wouldn't be any fish in the sea since they feed on these larval fish. So safeguarding marine life is essential to keeping that delicate balance. </p>
